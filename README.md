Voice-to-Action-WPF-SC is a project designed to recognize voice commands and convert them to text using the built-in Windows speech recognition feature (Win+H). The user's predefined commands trigger specific operations, making interactions more seamless and efficient. This project is currently under development, with many exciting features yet to come. Thank you!
